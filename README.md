# Solmate: Your Solana-Powered Digital Pet

This repository contains the complete Solmate project, a Tamagotchi-like digital pet experience integrated with the Solana blockchain. The project is divided into two main components: a Flutter-based mobile frontend and a Node.js/Express backend API.

## Core Features

*   **Solana Wallet Integration:** Each Solmate is linked to a user's Solana mobile wallet address.

*   **Customization:** Personalize your Solmate with various decorations and backgrounds, some unlockable by level, others purchasable with SOL.

*   **Leaderboards:** Compete globally on run high scores and survival time.
*   **Sprite Generation:** Unique sprites are dynamically generated for each Solmate based on its owner's public key.
